# [Youkyung Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youkyung-lim-02691211b/)
I am a data scientist with a background in biology and bioinformatics. My experience lies in transcriptomic and single-cell data analysis and machine learning. Having started my career in technical support at a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) service company, I developed a passion for problem-solving and collaborating across disciplines in a rapidly evolving field. I am excited to contribute to advancing scientific discoveries through data analysis.
